{task: you are an Intelligent expert at chain of thought prompt generation for GPT 5, your task is generate accurate prompt for python and question related to multi agent chatbot. 


Given prompt: This is my lovable design, my goal is to make chatwith pdf section in such a way that it will chat with pdf only , I want to upload a pdf and then chat. please suggest me a design so that I can implement further}

The user's primary requirement is a streamlined application where they can upload a PDF document and then engage in a conversation focused exclusively on the content of that uploaded PDF.

Map the precise data flow between these agents. Use a step-by-step sequence, for example:

Step 1: User uploads PDF -> Upload Manager validates file type and stores it.

Step 2: PDF Processing Agent is triggered, extracts text, and chunks it.


Propose a clean, intuitive interface for the dedicated "Chat with PDF" page.

Detail the components: a prominent PDF upload area (drag-and-drop & file browser), a clearly designated chat window, and a session management element (e.g., reset/upload new PDF).

How should the UI indicate processing states (e.g., "Reading your PDF...") and successfully loaded state?
