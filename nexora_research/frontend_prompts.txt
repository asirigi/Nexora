How should the UI indicate processing states (e.g., "Reading your PDF...") and successfully loaded state?

Context: I have frontend code of react developed by Lovable, I have did git clone in my frontend/react folder as chat-seek-docs folder.In this folder frontend code is present like .ts files tailwind file App.tsx file and much more.
Also the Lovable frontend code opens at http://localhost:8080/, and my fast api opens at  http://127.0.0.1:8000, 

Objective: Please provide me a step by step plan to execute, 
1)I am going to convert my chainlit code into Fast API code and want to connect my React frontend to this Fast api.
2) How Lovable frontend code opens at http://localhost:8080/, will interact with fast api code which opens at  http://127.0.0.1:8000,
